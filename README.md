# README

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`linear_regression.ipynb`) that demonstrates various regression techniques using Python. The notebook includes the following:

- Data imports and initial setup
- Data visualization
- Implementation of different regression models
- Evaluation of model performance

## Contents

### Notebook Structure

The notebook is divided into several sections, each with a specific purpose:

1. **Imports**: 
    - This section includes necessary imports such as `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `pandas`.

2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: 
    - Loading datasets and preprocessing steps.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
    - Visualizations and statistical analysis to understand the data.

4. **Regression Models**: 
    - Implementation of various regression models, including but not limited to:
        - Linear Regression
        - Polynomial Regression
        - Ridge and Lasso Regression

5. **Model Evaluation**: 
    - Evaluation metrics and techniques to assess the performance of the regression models.

### Code and Markdown Cells

- **Markdown Cells**: 
    - Provide explanations, headings, and descriptions for each section of the notebook.
    
- **Code Cells**: 
    - Contain Python code to perform data analysis, modeling, and visualization.

## How to Use

1. **Prerequisites**: 
    - Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install the required libraries using:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
    ```

2. **Running the Notebook**: 
    - Open the notebook using Jupyter:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook regression_practice.ipynb
    ```
    - Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and results.
